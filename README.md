# Word-Guess-CLI

Word Guess CLI is a Hangman style game that runs as a console app.

A word is selected from an array of puzzle words within the program.  This word is displayed as underscores
on the screen.  The user's task is to guess the word by entering letters at the console prompt.

When correct letters are selected the letters are displayed within the puzzle.

The user has a limit of between 8 and 10 'wrong' guesses to complete the puzzle depending on the size of the word.

The program shows the correct answer after the limit of wrong guesses has been reached.

This game utilizes object constructors for Words and letters, which are contained in separate files.
